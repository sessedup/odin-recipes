    <h1>Loco Moco</h1>
    <img src="../images/locomoco.jpg">
    <h3>Right out of the gate the name of this recipe seems crazy, I know, and the story behind it is pretty funny.  Legend has it that a group of kids from a local gym and their parents went into a diner in Hawaii and asked for something different than a sandwich and with a bowl of rice, hence this recipe.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 peeled small diced sweet onion</li>
        <li>2 finely minced cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 pounds 80/20 ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>5 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>¼ cups sliced green onions</li>
        <li>sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, beef, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce to a large bowl and mix until completely combined. Form into 5 patties and season on both sides with salt and pepper and set on a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the oil to a very large frying pan over medium heat and once it begins to lightly smoke add the hamburger patties in and cook for 3-4 minutes per side or until well browned on each side. See doneness note.</li>
        <li>Set the hamburger aside and drain off ½ of the oil used to cook the ground beef into a small frying pan and set the small pan aside.</li>
        <li>In the large frying pan over medium heat add in the mushrooms and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add in the flour and stir it in until it is completely combined,</li>
        <li>Pour in the beef stock, remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and cook for 3-4 more minutes over medium heat until it becomes thick like gravy.</li>
        <li>Add back in the cooked meat patties and simmer over low heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the eggs 1 at a time in the small frying pan in the rendered meat fat over medium heat for 30 seconds for a sunny-side-up egg.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef patties and mushroom sauce over top of the cooked jasmine rice and top off with the fried egg and garnish with sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make-Ahead: You can make this recipe up to 2 hours ahead of time, simply keep the hamburger patties into the gravy while covered in very low simmering heat. Likewise, keep the rice warm.</p>
    <p>How to Reheat: Add the desired amount of beef and gravy to a saucepan and heat over low heat until hot.</p>
