    <h3> I revised a recipe that my family loved so it would be lighter and easier to make. It’s a hearty and healthy meal served with a green salad and fresh bread. — Sue West, Alvord, Texas</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
        <li>1 package (16 ounces) frozen mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 cans (10-3/4 ounces each) reduced-fat reduced-sodium condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>    In a large saucepan, bring broth and onion to a boil. Reduce heat. Add the vegetables; cover and cook for 6-8 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in chicken and soup; heat through.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We really liked this soup!  It was better than I was expecting.  It was tasty and fresh.  I used the California mixed vegetables with broccoli, carrots and cauliflower.  I really liked those vegetables in it.  My son who is picky also really enjoyed it.  I made it with grilled cheese on french bread and it was a great meal.</p>
    <p>A very calm soup....comforting.</p>
